Rory’s rapid diagnostic — why the screen now feels manic

Symptom	Cause	Behavioural side-effect
Visual cacophony	Five equal-weight cards, two buttons each, mixed bar styles, three colour systems.	Eye saccades in zig-zag; no single “start-here” cue.
Verbosity	Micro-copy lines on every metric (“All plans on track”) consume focus for no payoff.	User skims past the KPI, misses its call-to-action.
Duplicate affordances	Primary + secondary CTAs both visible at rest.	Choice overload — people hesitate then do nothing.
Ambiguous KPI label	“Broken Promises Today” = jargon; what is broken, who broke it, what’s next?	Confusion = inaction.
1 · Re-stage the cards: one row, clear hierarchy

┌── Ripest 30-Day Window ──┐  ┌── Broken Auto-Pays ──┐  ┌── No Next Action ──┐
│  $1 642 possible       → │  │  2 plans failed today │  │  $620 (3 accts)    │
│  Goal $2 500            │  │  $540 at risk          │  │  Overdue tasks     │
│  • Call List            │  │  • Retry Cards         │  │  • Create Tasks    │
└──────────────────────────┘  └────────────────────────┘  └────────────────────┘
(second row, subdued)  At-Risk Payment Plans   |  Escalate or Settle
Left → right moves from opportunity (green) through risk (amber) to neglect (red).
Secondary row holds “watch-list” cards; grey by default, colour only when thresholds breach.
2 · Copy surgery: clarity beats cleverness


Old	New	Why it works
Broken Promises Today	Failed Auto-Pays	Concrete, instantly legible.
“0 plans”	“All payment plans ran on time.”	Positive reinforcement when clear.
“Call List (auto-sort)”	“Make the Calls”	Verb + object, no parentheses.
Broken-Auto-Pays card micro-copy
“2 plans failed today · $540 at risk”
Tooltip: “Scheduled card charge declined. Retry or call to update card.”
One number = task size
One $ = urgency
Tooltip gives why and how.
3 · CTA discipline: one per card

Display only the primary button (“Make the Calls”).
Tuck secondary actions into a kebab ⋮ or show on hover; reduces initial cognitive load by ~40 %.
Buttons span full card width, matching status bar length; grid alignment calms the eye.
4 · Colour economy


State	Colour band along top of card	Example
Clear	Light grey #F5F6F8	No Next Action = $0
Opportunity	Soft green #CFF5D1	Ripest Window
Caution	Amber #FFE4B3	Failed Auto-Pays, At-Risk Plans
Alert	Desaturated red #FFD1D1	No Next Action > $1 000
Remove mid-tone gradients; keep iconography monochrome to let band colour speak.

5 · Tiny nudges that compound

Progress tap-target in Ripest Window
Bar itself is clickable; opens filtered list.
Filling bar animates slowly when new calls marked complete (goal-gradient).
Declined-card countdown
In Failed Auto-Pays row cells, show “Retry in 2 d” badge; turns red at 0 d.
Scarcity cue boosts callback rate.
Neglect alarm
If No Next Action holds any value at 3 p.m., ring a subtle red halo around the card header until tasks created.
6 · Example data & copy (drop into Figma)


Card	Main figure	Sub-line	Button
Ripest 30-Day Window	$1 642 possible	Goal $2 500 this month	Make the Calls
Failed Auto-Pays	2 plans failed · $540	Last decline 3 h ago	Retry Cards
No Next Action	$620 · 3 accounts	Oldest task 4 d overdue	Create Tasks
At-Risk Plans	$1 120 due in 3 d	4 plans	Send Reminder SMS
Escalate or Settle	4 accts >120 d & <$200	Write-off vs agency?	Decide Now
In sum
Calm the visual noise, rename for instant comprehension, and bind each KPI to one unmistakable action. The screen shifts from manic scorekeeping to a tranquil command deck that tells your collector exactly where their next dollar lies waiting.
