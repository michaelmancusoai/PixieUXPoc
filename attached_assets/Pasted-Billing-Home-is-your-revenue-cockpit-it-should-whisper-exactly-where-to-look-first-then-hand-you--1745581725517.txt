Billing Home is your revenue cockpit — it should whisper exactly where to look first, then hand you the switch that fixes it.
Right now it’s a polite directory with four vanity totals (“Monthly Revenue”, “Patient A/R”) and six navigation tiles you’ve already given people in the tab-bar above. Nothing on the page changes anyone’s behaviour at 9 a.m.

Below is a redesign that keeps the calm aesthetic you’ve adopted for Payments / Statements / Collections, but turns Billing Home into a daily triage console.

1 · Recast the hero row: from vanity totals to actionable leak-meters


New card	Data shown	Why it matters	CTA (single button)
Unbilled Procedures	$3 780 (23 completed today)	Every day unfiled is a day revenue waits	Create Claims
Draft Claims	5 claims · $2 150	Dollars sitting in drafts queue	Send Claims
Denied / Rejected	3 claims · $940	Fix now → cash in ≤ 7 days	Correct & Resubmit
Patient A/R Aging > 30 d	$1 860 (14 pts)	Balances at risk of collections fees	Send Statements
Colour bands

Grey when metric = 0
Amber for soft threshold (e.g. draft > 0)
Coral when hard threshold reached (e.g. any denial)
Zero state copy: “No denials today — cup of tea time ☕”
2 · Replace the six nav tiles with Role-Smart Cards


Tile	Shows	Primary action
Today’s Claim Tasks	Drafts, denials, follow-ups count	Open Claim Queue
Today’s Payment Tasks	Patient-resp left to collect before 5 p.m.	Unpaid Check-outs
Today’s Statement Tasks	Statements awaiting first reminder	Send Reminders
Collections Watch	Aging > 90 d bucket	View Over 90 d
Fee-Schedule Alerts	Plans > 18 mo old	Review Fees
Each card loads with only the numbers relevant to the logged-in role. A billing specialist might see all five; a front-desk user sees just Claims, Payments, Statements.

3 · Add a slim “Revenue Radar” strip for leadership

Revenue Radar — Forecast Month-End
┌──────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬───────────────┐
| On-track $   | At-risk $   | Stalled $   | Won back $    |
| $22,840      | $4,950      | $1,860      | $2,310        |
└──────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴───────────────┘
Hover → tooltip explains calculation. Click → pre-filtered report.

4 · Behavioural nudges


Trigger	Nudge
Draft Claims > 0 at 3 p.m.	Red halo on card header: “Send now to avoid an extra day’s float.”
Denials cleared to zero	Confetti tick 1 s; card fades to mint.
Fee Schedules > 18 mo	Amber badge: “Out-of-date fees cost ~8 % revenue.”
5 · Micro-copy swaps


Old	New
“Outstanding Claims”	“Draft claims — revenue on your desk”
“Patient A/R Balance”	“Balances aging — nudge before month-end”
“Collections”	“Already in collections (fees rising)”
Short, verb-ready, loss-averse.

6 · Designer checklist

Hero row = 4 equal cards, single CTA, band colour per status.
Role-Smart cards use same component but default grey header; colourise only when attention needed.
Remove the six navigation buttons; primary nav already lives in the sub-tabs.
Maintain the calm white space and single-colour icon set used elsewhere.
Ensure every dollar figure has a tooltip: formula + data source.
End result
Billing Home becomes the one-glance triage board: “Send these drafts, fix those denials, nudge that aging bucket — then go to lunch.” Vanity totals move to monthly reports; the home screen now pushes the precise levers that free cash today.
