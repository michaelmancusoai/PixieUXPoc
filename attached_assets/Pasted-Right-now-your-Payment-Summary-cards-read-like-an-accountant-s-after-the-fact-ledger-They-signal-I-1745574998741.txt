Right now your Payment Summary cards read like an accountant’s after-the-fact ledger. They signal “Interesting” but not “Act Now.” A front-office or billing coordinator needs leading indicators that point to preventable leakage—dollars about to slip away or workflow snarls that will force tomorrow’s apologetic phone calls.

1 · Replace passive KPIs with behaviour-changing ones


Replace this…	…with this KPI	Why it motivates action (Rory’s lens)	Visual hint
Total $ Collected Today	Same-Day Collection Rate (Patient-responsibility dollars collected before patient leaves)	Creates an “honour to be kept” norm; staff hate seeing it dip below 90 %.	Progress bar that turns green ≥ 95 %
Avg. Payment	% Auto-Payments (Card-on-File)	Reinforces the card-on-file quest; every stored card nudges this metric up.	Coin icon fills as % rises
Success Rate (generic)	First-Attempt Success (transactions w/out retry)	Highlights terminal issues before they create phone work.	Red badge appears when < 97 %
n/a	Pending Verifications (e-checks & ACH still in limbo)	Shows dollars “stuck in clearing”; brings latent risk into view.	Amber clock icon + $ amount
Refunded $	Preventable Refunds (refunds caused by card errors / wrong amounts)	Anchors staff to root-cause thinking, not just dollar flow.	Tooltip links to offending transactions
2 · Fold in leading indicators from Claims

80 % of patient balance pain begins with claim rejections and partial pays. Add a slim “Claims Risk” pill above the payment grid:

Claims Risk: $3 250 at risk (12 claims) → Tap to see root causes
Clicking jumps to Claims filtered on “Action Needed.” Now the payment screen also feels like an early-warning radar.

3 · Behavioural dashboard layout (wireframe in words)

┌────────────────────┬────────────────────┬────────────────────┐
│ Same-Day Collection│ Card-on-File %     │ First-Attempt Paid │
│ 82 % [▃▃▅▆▇  ]     │ 37 % [▂▅▅▆▃ ]     │ 98.4 % [green]     │
└────────────────────┴────────────────────┴────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Claims Risk  $3,250 amber   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
Progress bars unlock the goal-gradient effect; colour only appears when things need applause or attention.

4 · Quick-Action buttons that shorten the gap between insight and fix


Insight card	Default CTA	Hover secondary
Same-Day Collection < 90 %	“View unchecked-out patients”	“Send pay-link SMS”
Card-on-File % target unmet	“Open today’s schedule” (highlights patients w/out stored card)	“Print countertop tent card”
Pending Verifications > $0	“View unsettled ACHs”	“Email clearing report”
Preventable Refunds>0	“See root-cause list”	“Tag to Training module”
5 · Micro-copy swaps (small but mighty)


Current	Rory-fied
“Pending payments”	“$150 in limbo — chase or wait?”
“Success rate 88 %”	“12 % failed first try – rescue before it rolls to phone calls.”
“Refunded $76”	“$76 paid twice — let’s stop the déjà-vu.”
6 · Tiny nudges that pay compound interest

Endowed progress bar on Card-on-File: start every Monday with last week’s percentage faint-filled. Staff feel “almost there” from the get-go.
Loss aversion toast when Same-Day dips: “Every 1 % drop costs $240 a month—shall we text pending patients?”
Streak badge: “3 consecutive days ≥ 95 % Same-Day Collection—protect the streak!”
Take-away for the design team
Swap ledger metrics for leakage metrics. Ask: “Does this number prod someone to do something within the next hour?”
Give every metric a direct button. Never make users hunt in another tab.
Celebrate upwards motion, flag downward drift early. Green and red should earn their screen real estate.
Focus on preventing tomorrow’s billing fires today—and your payment screen will shift from rear-view bookkeeping to a behavioural cockpit that keeps revenue (and receptionist morale) humming.
