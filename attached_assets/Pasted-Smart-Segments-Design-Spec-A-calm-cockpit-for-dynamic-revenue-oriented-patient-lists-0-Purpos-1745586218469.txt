Smart Segments — Design Spec
A calm cockpit for dynamic, revenue-oriented patient lists.

0 · Purpose (in one line)

Create, save, and act on live patient segments (recall-due, high-balance, FSA-expiring, etc.) so the team can fill chairs, collect balances, and close data gaps in minutes rather than spreadsheets.
1 · Page Anatomy


Zone	Span	Question it answers	Key components
Hero KPI trio	full-width row	“Which segments are leaking—or ripe—today?”	3 actionable cards
Saved Segment Gallery	9⁄12 cols	“What lists already exist & how healthy are they?”	Segment tiles ( Kanban style )
Filter Builder / Segment Drawer	3⁄12 cols (sticky)	“Create or edit a segment right here.”	Multi-step builder
Bulk-Action Bar	bottom dock	“Do something to the checked segments.”	Contextual buttons
2 · Hero KPI Cards (one CTA each)


Card	Metric & copy	CTA	Colour logic
Recall Due (Next 7 d)	26 pts · $7 280 prod at risk	Book Hygiene	Amber if ≥20 Coral ≥30
High Balance > $300	14 pts · $4 960 unpaid	Collect Now	Amber ≥10 Coral ≥20
Data Gaps	9 charts incomplete (DOB / Ins.)	Fix Info	Amber ≥5 Coral ≥10
Zero state copy on each: “All clear—nothing leaking.”
