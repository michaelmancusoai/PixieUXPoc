Why “Collections” needs different KPIs from “Payments” or “Statements”
At this stage you’re no longer persuading; you’re recovering. Collections should shine a 1 000-watt beam on three things only:

Ripest fruit (dollars most likely to be recovered today)
Rotting fruit (accounts drifting past a recovery threshold)
Broken promises (payment plans that just slipped)
Every widget must either reduce aging days or raise promise-kept % before the month closes.

1 · Swap ledger cards for “act-now” recovery KPIs


Replace this card	With this KPI	Why it triggers behaviour	Visual
Accounts > 90 d $8 899	No Next Action – $ value + account count	Staff hate seeing a red number labelled “abandoned.”	Red pill; tap filters grid to those accounts
Collected This Month $1 250	Ripest 30 d Window – $ due in next 30 days if calls made	Puts a reachable carrot in front of the collector.	Green progress bar to monthly goal
Recovery Rate 43 %	Broken Promises Today – # plans missed yesterday	Fresh pain → immediate call; goal is zero.	Amber exclamation when > 0
Adherence 82 %	Payment-Plan At-Risk – $ where next instalment is in 3 days	Three-day runway allows salvage.	Clock icon fills as day approaches
n/a	Escalate or Settle – accounts > 120 d & <$200	Quick decision: write-off vs. agency.	Tiny toggle CTA: “Choose now”
Wireframe in words

Tap any card → grid auto-filters to those accounts.

2 · Action buttons stitched to each KPI


KPI widget	Primary CTA	Hover secondary
No Next Action	“Create Tasks” (opens bulk task modal)	“Auto-schedule SMS”
Ripest Window	“Call List (auto-sort)”	“Send payment-portal link”
Broken Promises	“Retry cards”	“Mark as contact attempted”
At-Risk Plans	“Pre-emptive reminder SMS”	“Offer split plan”
Escalate/Settle	“Write-off vs. Agency” wizard	“Tag for dentist review”
3 · Copy tweaks that speak collector language


Current	Rory-style
“Collected this month”	“Won back this month — let’s add $X more.”
“Adherence rate 82 %”	“18 % of plans wobbling — steady them before Friday.”
“Recovery rate 43 %”	“57 % still out there — fetchable with calls & links.”
4 · Grid enhancements that match the new KPIs

Next Action column becomes Time-Until-Next, colour-coded:
Green ≤ 24 h | Amber 1-3 d | Red overdue
Promise-Kept % mini-badge on every payment-plan row.
Quick-resolve dropdown on low-balance, high-age rows: Write-off / Agency / Extend.
5 · Behavioural nudges & rituals


Nudge	Trigger	Text
Red pulse on “No Next Action”	Card > $0 at 10 AM	“These 9 accts are silent — give them a voice.”
Amber toast after Broken Promise list clears	all promises contacted	“Nice catch! Plans back on track.”
Green confetti tick	All KPI cards green	“Ledger tamed for today — time for a victory coffee ☕.”
6 · Designer checklist

KPI cards use colour sparingly: grey default, colour only when action/celebration required.
Provide single-tap CTAs on every card; match hover secondary.
Progress visuals: stacked bars for ageing, rings for percentage goals.
Ensure empty-state copy celebrates zeroes: “No plans wobbling — splendid.”
Shift the Collections page from a sombre graveyard of 90-day balances to a battle map of actionable recoveries and your staff will spend less time doom-scrolling dollars lost, more time pressing the green buttons that fetch them back.
