Below is a **fully-self-contained design artifact**—updated to remove all audio cues, fill every surrender/resume edge-case, and retain the 8-bit quest spirit. Treat this as the single spec your designers will consult.

## 1 · Theme & Visual Tone  
Retro-arcade quest—pixel clouds, pixel coins, pixel fireworks—without naming any specific franchise.

| Level | Palette cue | Mood |
|-------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Sky blue + white clouds | Friendly tutorial |
| 2 | Warm desert tan | Adventurer’s trail |
| 3 | Lava-orange on dark brick | Final showdown |

## 2 ·  Feature: “Card-on-File Daily Challenge”

### Gherkin Scenarios (plain-English BDD)  

```gherkin
Feature: Front-Desk Daily Challenge – Card on File
  Goal: Encourage staff to ask patients to store a payment card, via a fun 8-bit mini-game.

  Background:
    Given Maria is logged in as Front-Office Coordinator
    And the Daily Challenge card is visible below the Impact Queue

############################################
# LEVEL 1 — THREE COINS
############################################

  Scenario: First load briefing
    When the component loads for the first time today
    Then show a blue card containing:
      | title      | "Daily Challenge!" |
      | objective  | "Collect 3 coins by asking patients to save a card on file." |
      | icons      | ○ ○ ○ (three hollow coins) |
      | buttons    | Mission Accepted (primary) · Quit Game (secondary) |

  Scenario: Mission accepted
    When Maria taps "Mission Accepted"
    Then hide the briefing prompt and leave the three hollow coins
    And show a tiny red “Cancel Quest” link in the card header

  Scenario: Coin earned
    Given a patient agrees to store their card
    When the event is logged
    Then flip the left-most hollow coin to a shimmering gold coin
    And update tooltip to "Great! 2 coins to go."

  Scenario: Level-1 completion
    Given all three coins are gold
    Then overlay pixel-confetti for 1.5 s
    And replace card content with:
      | headline | "Level 1 complete! Checkout just got faster." |
      | prompt   | "Ready to tackle **Level 2** and collect 5 coins?" |
      | buttons  | Mission Accepted · I Surrender |

############################################
# LEVEL 2 — FIVE COINS
############################################

  Scenario: Level-2 briefing
    When Maria accepts Level 2
    Then switch card palette to desert tan
    And render five hollow coins ○○○○○
    And show red "Cancel Quest" link

  Scenario: Level-2 play
    Repeat Coin earned logic until 5 gold coins

  Scenario: Level-2 completion
    When 5 coins turn gold
    Then overlay larger pixel-fireworks for 2 s
    And prompt: "Too easy… Dare to face the Final Level for 10 coins?"
    And buttons: Mission Accepted · I Surrender

############################################
# FINAL LEVEL — TEN COINS
############################################

  Scenario: Final-level briefing
    When Maria accepts Final Level
    Then change palette to lava-orange on dark brick
    And display ten hollow coins

  Scenario: Winning the game
    When all ten coins are gold
    Then overlay full-screen pixel-fireworks for 3 s
    And drop a golden trophy icon onto the card
    And auto-collapse card to a “Victory Bar” showing:
      | trophy   | 🏆 |
      | text     | "Challenge conquered! 10 coins collected." |
      | streak   | "Streak: N days" |
      | button   | disabled "Resume game tomorrow" |

############################################
# SURRENDER & RESUME (ALL LEVELS)
############################################

  Scenario: User surrenders mid-level
    When Maria taps "I Surrender" or "Quit Game"
    Then animate a small white flag rising
    And fold the card vertically into a slim bar showing:
      | text   | "Paused: {goldCoins}/target coins banked." |
      | button | "Resume Game" |
      | teaser | "Do you dare to resume your quest?" |

  Scenario: Resuming after surrender
    When Maria taps "Resume Game"
    Then restore card to the last in-progress state
    And keep previously earned gold coins intact

  Scenario: Cancel Quest link
    When Maria clicks "Cancel Quest"
    Then trigger the same surrender flow

############################################
# STREAK & DAILY RESET
############################################

  Rule: Streak counter
    • Increment streak when Level 1 is completed  
    • Reset streak if no level completed by 11:59 PM

  Rule: Streak-in-peril nudge
    If 0 coins earned by 12:00 PM
    Then badge the card header with amber "Streak in peril – collect a coin!"

  Scenario: New day reset
    At 4:00 AM local time
    Then restore blue Level-1 briefing with fresh hollow coins
    And keep streak number visible
```

## 3 ·  Micro-copy Library  

| Context                | Copy text                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Coin earned toast      | “Coin collected! One less billing call tomorrow.”         |
| Level clear headline   | “Level X complete! Checkout speed +1.”                   |
| Streak in peril badge  | “Streak in peril – collect a coin!”                       |
| Surrender collapsed    | “Paused: 2/5 coins banked.”                               |
| Resume button          | “Resume Game”                                             |

## 4 ·  Office Leaderboard (social proof)

```gherkin
Feature: Daily Game Leaderboard
  Purpose: Friendly competition and recognition across roles.

  Scenario: Display leaderboard
    Given the user opens "Leaderboard"
    Then show ranked list with columns:
      | Rank | Name | Role | Coins Today | Streak |
    And break ties on streak length
    And top rank has a tiny pixel crown

  Scenario: End-of-day archive
    At 11:59 PM
    Then save today’s leaderboard to history
    And reset daily coin counts to zero
```

Leaderboard copy:

- Heading : “🏆 Today’s Arcade Champs”
- Sub-line : “Coins first, streaks break ties — keep the quest alive!”

---

## 5 ·  Motion & Accessibility (designers only)  

- **Motion**  
  - Coins spin once clockwise when earned  
  - Pixel-confetti/fireworks use 2-colour bursts, max 3 s  
  - Card fold animation ≤ 400 ms  

- **No audio cues** — celebrate solely via motion & colour.  
- **Colour-blind support** — use distinct shapes (hollow vs. filled coins) and text labels.  

---

Everything the designer needs—states, visuals, copy, surrender logic, streak rules, and leaderboard mechanics—is captured here. No technical jargon, no hidden gaps.
