Capacity Planner — turning blank chair-time into booked revenue
Design blueprint (Rory-style) for the new Schedule ▸ Capacity page.

0 · One-sentence purpose

See at a glance where your chairs and clinicians are under- or over-booked during the next two weeks, and act on the gaps without ever leaving the view.

5 · Micro-interactions


Action	Feedback
Gap filled	Cell animates green pulse → grid re-calculates KPI bars in header (goal-gradient).
Hover KPI card	Shows formula + link “How calculated?”.
Hover empty heatmap cell	Faint dotted outline + “Drag patient here”.
KPI turns green	1-second confetti tick at card corner.
6 · Copy primer

Chair Utilisation: “Booked vs possible chair-time next 2 weeks.”
Prime-Time Gaps: “Unused peak hours patients actually want.”
Provider Imbalance: “Spread work evenly to avoid burnout + overtime.”
Rebalance tooltip: “Move low-value checks from Dr Sisko to Dr Nguyen’s lighter afternoons.”
Tone = coach, not scold.

7 · Behavioural nudges

Scarcity framing: Prime-Time card shows “4 prime slots left — fill before 10 a.m.”
Endowed progress: Utilisation bar shows faint grey to 100 % so 76 % already feels “nearly there.”
Loss aversion: Tooltip on Unbooked Tx: “Every week delay ≈ $900 unrecovered.”
