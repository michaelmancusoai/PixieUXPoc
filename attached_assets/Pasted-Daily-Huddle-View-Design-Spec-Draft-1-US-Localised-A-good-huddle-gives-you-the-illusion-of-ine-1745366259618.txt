Daily Huddle View Design Spec – Draft 1 (US‑Localised)

“A good huddle gives you the illusion of inevitability—you leave believing the day can’t help but go to plan.” — Rory Sutherland

The Daily Huddle view is a 5‑minute, staff‑facing snapshot that primes the team for a flawless day. It rolls yesterday’s lessons into today’s objectives and highlights risks before they turn into bottlenecks.
