Where the Statements page now over-signals (and how to calm it)

Tension point	Why it feels noisy	How to quiet it
Six equal-weight tiles	The eye hops like a pinball—no obvious “start here.”	Give the page a hero trio (primary KPIs) on Row 1, then a slimmer “support rail” for secondary widgets.
Mixed iconography	Bell, triangle, pie-ring, coins, phone… all competing.	Limit to one icon family and reserve badge colour for status (clear, warn, alert).
Two CTAs per card	Each tile demands choice, triggering micro-friction.	Show one default action; reveal alternates on hover or ⋮ menu.
Tiny to-do list duplicated	To-Do items repeat themes already shown in tiles (e.g., “Send 2 draft statements”).	Merge the list into a single “Today’s Actions” button that just filters the grid.
1 · Restaged layout – one calm focus row

┌─ Unsent Drafts ────┐  ┌─ Need First Reminder ─┐  ┌─ Balances ≥30d ───┐
│ 2 drafts  ·  $700  │  │ 3 stmts  · 14+ days   │  │ $0 stuck          │
│ CTA: Send Drafts   │  │ CTA: Run Reminders    │  │ CTA: View Aging    │
└────────────────────┘  └───────────────────────┘  └────────────────────┘
                 (secondary rail – subdued grey)
 e-Statement Gap  |  High-Balance Watchlist  |  Escalate / Settle
Left-to-right flow = unreleased → unnudged → unresolved
Secondary rail stays grey until a threshold is breached.
2 · KPI copy tuned for instant comprehension


Card title	Main line	Sub-line	CTA
Unsent Drafts	2 statements waiting	“$700 still on your desk”	Send Drafts
Need First Reminder	3 statements stalled	“Sent 14 days ago, no nudge”	Run Reminders
Balances ≥ 30 Days	$0 stuck (nice!)	“0 pts over 30 d”	View Aging (disabled)
e-Statement Gap	70 % adopted	“3 patients still on paper”	Invite Paperless
High-Balance Watchlist	Top 3 names + $	—	Call pill beside each
Escalate / Settle	0 accts > 120 d & < $200	—	Decide (grey until needed)
3 · Visual vocabulary


Element	Colour band	When used
Clear state	Light grey #F4F6F8	No action needed
Attention	Amber #FFE4B3	KPI above soft threshold
Alert	Coral #FFB4B4	KPI above hard threshold
Success	Mint #CFF5D1	KPI hits target (e.g., $0 aging)
One icon family (outlined 24 px).
Progress bars share width, 4 px height.
Remove secondary shadows; let white space breathe.
4 · Single-action discipline

Default CTA fills full card width.
Secondary actions live in a subtle ⋮ menu revealed on hover to avoid split-second decision fatigue.
Example:
Send Drafts (primary)
⋮ → “Auto-email all” | “Print bundle”
5 · Replace the micro to-do list with a single filter button

Today’s Action Queue   [ Show 3 items ]
Click → grid filters to drafts + 14-day + paper invites.
Why: one mental pivot instead of scanning a separate list.

6 · Gentle nudges


Situation	Nudge
Unsent Drafts > 0 at 11 AM	Red dot on nav tab + pulse on card border
Need First Reminder flagged	Toast after run: “Nicely nudged! Expect 40 % faster pay.”
e-Statement adoption hits 80 %	Confetti tick (1 s) then card fades to grey
Designer’s one-pager checklist
Row 1 = three hero cards (equal width).
Row 2 secondary rail uses smaller text and grey background until activated.
Progress bars & colour bands obey the four-colour vocabulary only.
One CTA per card at rest; others on ⋮ hover.
Remove “Today’s To-Do List” card; replace with Action Queue filter button.
With hierarchy, restrained colour, and “one action per tile,” the Statements dashboard shifts from energetic chatter to a clear daily agenda that lets staff glance, click, and move money—without the manic noise.
