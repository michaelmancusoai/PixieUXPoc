Why the current Statement KPIs fall flat
They report, they don’t prompt. “Average time to pay” is interesting once a quarter; it doesn’t tell Marie what to do at 10 a.m. on a Tuesday.
They celebrate the middle, not the edges. The danger in a statements workflow is unsent drafts and ageing balances, yet those numbers are hidden two clicks down.
They frame success in finance-team language (“$2 391.50 active”) instead of patient-resolution language (“5 families need nudging today”).
1 · Swap in KPIs that create urgency (and quick wins)


Replace this card	With this actionable KPI	Why it matters (behavioural lens)	What the widget looks like
Current Statements – $ value	Unsent Drafts – count + dollar value	Eliminates “hidden queue” waste; front desk can clear it in minutes.	Red badge when > 0 drafts
Statement Activity – $ overdue	Balances Ageing ≥ 30 days	Surfaces balances about to enter collections; taps loss aversion.	Horizontal stacked bar: 30, 60, 90 days
Avg. Time to Pay	Need First Reminder – count of statements > 14 days, no follow-up	Creates a do-it-now task that halves payment lag.	Amber clock icon appears when > 0
E-Statement adoption	e-Statement Opt-In Gap – patients who could go paperless but haven’t	Prompts a one-click email blast; future savings + faster pay.	Progress ring towards 100 %
Avg. Statement $	High-Balance Watchlist – top three patient balances	Big numbers focus the mind; align with Pareto principle.	Mini table with “Call” CTA

2 · Button the insight to the fix


KPI widget	Primary CTA	Hover secondary
Unsent Drafts	“Open Drafts Queue”	“Auto-email all drafts”
Balances 30 days+	“Send Statement Reminders”	“Filter grid → 30 days”
Need First Reminder	“Run 14-Day nudge”	“Schedule SMS follow-up”
e-Statement Gap	“Invite to Paperless”	“Print opt-in forms”
High-Balance list	Call icon on each row	“Offer payment plan”
3 · Micro-copy swaps (make it human)


Old text	Rory-style alternative
“Overdue amount”	“Stuck balances (patients haven’t budged)”
“Drafts”	“Unsent drafts — money still on your desk”
“Avg. time to pay 12 days”	“It takes 12 days to get paid — want it in 7?”
“Collection rate 94 %”	“6 % still missing — fetch it before month-end”
4 · Nudges & rituals

Morning red dot on “Unsent Drafts” if > 0 — staff feel compelled to zero it before coffee.
Amber pulse on “Need First Reminder” exactly 14 days after send; disappears once the reminder batch is triggered.
Green confetti tick (2 s) when all KPIs show “Clear” — cues end-of-day satisfaction.
Friday footer tip: “Paper statements cost $0.58 each; flip two more families to e-statements, save $300/year.”
Design takeaway
Lead with preventable leakage, not historical totals.
Attach every metric to a single, obvious next step.
Reward zero states (all clear) so staff feel the pleasure of a tidy ledger.
Do that, and the Statements screen stops mimicking an accounting report and starts acting like a revenue-rescue playbook.
