Prospects — Design Spec
A single cockpit that turns every new inquiry into a scheduled, revenue-generating visit.

0 · Purpose in one line

Track, triage, and convert new leads and referrals through a simple Kanban pipeline—with live KPIs that expose response-time leaks and one-tap actions to book, nurture, or disqualify.
