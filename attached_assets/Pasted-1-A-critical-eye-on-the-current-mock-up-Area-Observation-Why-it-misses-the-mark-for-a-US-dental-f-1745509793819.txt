1 — A critical eye on the current mock-up

Area	Observation	Why it misses the mark for a US dental front-desk team
Impact-Queue task mix	“Process credit-card payment … patient waiting at front desk” is redundant—Maria will already be doing that face-to-face. Tasks should be pre-emptive (before the patient arrives) or follow-up (after they’ve left).	Front-desk work oscillates between bursts of face-to-face activity and catch-up admin between patients. Queue items must live in those admin gaps.
	No tasks for insurance verification, benefits breakdown, or tomorrow’s pre-auths—the real time-sink of a US practice.	Verifying benefits the day before is the #1 predictor of on-time check-out and full payment.
	“Balance collected” KPI is practice-owner language, not receptionist language.	Behavioural studies show front-desk staff are motivated by people helped and problems averted, not gross revenue.
Progress KPIs	Bars use orange even when results are positive; colour should celebrate progress, not neutralise it.	Colour = emotion. Amber implies caution, undermining a half-finished success.
Win Feed	Only shows system actions, not Maria’s wins.	Recognition fuels intrinsic motivation.
Language tone	Priority “P1 / P2” reads like engineering jargon.	Natural language (“Do first”, “Later today”) removes cognitive translation.

2 — What really lives on a front-desk task list

(validated with practice-operations checklists & job descriptions  ￼ ￼)
	1.	Verify insurance eligibility for tomorrow’s patients.
	2.	Request missing X-ray from referring practice (pre-auth dependency).
	3.	Send hygiene recall texts to patients due next week.
	4.	Confirm lab case arrival for Thursday’s crown seats.
	5.	Reschedule failed confirmation gaps (tap wait-list).
	6.	Print new-patient forms for afternoon arrivals.
	7.	Prepare deposit slip & batch credit-card totals.
	8.	Order burs & prophy paste (inventory alert).
	9.	Scan and attach signed consents from morning patients.
	10.	Return voicemail from Mrs Lopez about financing options.

These are either before-visit prep or after-visit wrap-up—perfect for admin windows.
