1 · Hero Row — three cards that move money today


Card	Main metric & copy	Why it matters	Primary CTA (one action)	Colour logic
Unsent Claims	7 claims · $4 860 still in draft	Dollars literally waiting on your desk	Send Claims → filters grid to Draft	• Red band when count > 0
• Grey when 0
Payer Rejections	3 claims rejected · $1 120	Fix now to avoid 30-day rebill delay	Correct & Resubmit → opens first claim	• Amber when 1-5
• Red at 6+
Aging > 14 Days	$2 275 in limbo (9 claims)	No response from payer → follow-up call	Work Follow-ups → auto-sorted list	• Amber bar fills to red at 30 days
Left → right flow: Release → Repair → Recover.

2 · Support Rail (grey until threshold breached)


Widget	Breach rule	CTA
Missing Attachments	any claim flagged “info requested”	Attach Docs
Underpaid Alerts	payment < 95 % of contract fee	Review EOB
Pre-Auth Needed Soon	pre-auth expires < 14 days	Generate Pre-Auth
Coordination of Benefits	claims awaiting COB doc	Request Secondary Info
These sit in a light-grey second row; they light up in amber/red only when active.

3 · Copy cheatsheet


Scenario	Micro-copy
Unsent but 0	“All caught up — breathe easy.”
Rejections present	“Payer said no — let’s turn it into yes.”
Aging > 30 d	“Clock’s ticking: interest risk at 45 d.”
Missing Attachments (active)	“X-rays or photos requested — attach to unfreeze.”
Short, plain, verb-first.

4 · Behavioural cues

Red halo appears around Unsent Claims card at 3 p.m. if count > 0.
Rejections card header pulses once when a new denial lands.
Progress bar under Aging card grows daily; turns red at 30 d to trigger urgency.
When all hero cards grey, show a mint-green tick ribbon: “Claims runway clear — revisit at 2 p.m.”
5 · Designer checklist

Hero cards equal width; one CTA button spans card.
Use same four-colour palette already applied: Grey (clear) / Mint (success) / Amber (caution) / Coral (alert).
Icons: outline 24 px, one per card, consistent family.
Support-rail widgets 20 % smaller font, grey band until active.
Tooltip on every dollar figure explains calculation (e.g., “Sum of claim charges, not allowed amounts”).
Result
With Unsent, Rejected, and Aging as the hero trio—and silent support widgets that wake only when thresholds breach—the Claims page now slots neatly into your calmer, single-action billing suite, telling the billing team exactly: Release these dollars, repair those denials, recover that aging bucket — today.
