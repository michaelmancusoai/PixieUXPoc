Measures (a k a Patient Metrics) — Design Spec
A calm, owner-friendly analytics page that shows whether the practice is growing, holding, or leaking patients—and lets you jump straight to the underlying lists.

0 · Purpose in one line

Turn high-level patient analytics (growth, retention, production per patient) into simple tiles, trend charts, and click-through lists so leadership can spot drift and staff can act.
1 · Page anatomy


Zone	Span	Question answered	Components
Hero KPI quartet	full-width row	“Are we growing, retaining, and extracting value?”	4 actionable tiles
Trend canvas	9⁄12 cols	“How are key metrics moving over time?”	Stacked line + bar charts
Insights side-panel	3⁄12 cols (sticky)	“Explain the blips.”	Auto-generated call-outs + CTA links
Segment jump-off	under canvas	“See the patients behind the number.”	Buttons linking to Smart Segments
2 · Hero KPI tiles (actionable)


Tile	Metric & copy	CTA	Colour band
Active Patient Base	1 486 patients seen ≤ 18 m (+1.9 % MoM)	View Directory	Mint if +ve, grey if flat, coral if –ve
New Patients MTD	27 new (goal 40)	See Source Mix	Amber when < goal pace
Dormant 18-36 m	102 patients (–4 vs last month)	Reactivate List	Amber >75, coral >150
Hygiene Re-Appt Rate	87 % last 6 m (target 90 %)	Book Recalls	Mint ≥90, amber 80-89, coral <80
Each tile shows a 90-day sparkline in the corner; entire tile is a link to deeper segment.

3 · Trend canvas (main chart area)

A. Patient Flow Funnel (stacked bar, last 12 m)
Columns: New → Active → Dormant → Lost
Hover = count + YoY %.
Click a bar segment → opens Smart Segment with filters pre-applied.
B. Production per Active Patient (line, 12 m)
Grey baseline = industry average (ADA).
Green when above, amber when below 5 %.
C. Recall Compliance Cohort Heatmap (matrix)
Rows = month patient was due.
Columns = % booked within 2 w / 4 w / 8 w.
Red squares highlight slippage cohorts.
Canvas auto-switches to small-multiple view on screens < 1200 px.

4 · Insights side-panel

Dynamically surfaces anomalies:


Insight card	Trigger	Example copy	CTA
Spike in Lost Patients	Lost > 20 in a month	“April saw 24 patients move to Lost—largest in 9 m.”	View Lost Reasons
Low Conversion Source	Source conv < 30 %	“Facebook ads convert 22 % vs avg 41 %.”	See Leads
Recall Slippage	Cohort heatmap red	“June recall cohort only 54 % booked.”	Recall List
Panel scrolls; each insight card collapses after CTA click.

5 · Filter bar (top-right of canvas)

Time window: 3 m • 6 m • 12 m • Custom
Provider: All • Dentist picklist • Hygienist picklist
Source: All • Web • Referral • PPO list • Marketing code
Every filter change animates charts (200 ms fade).
6 · Segment jump-off buttons

Under canvas, four pill-buttons:

[ New pts list ]  [ Dormant list ]  [ Recall due list ]  [ Lost reasons ]
They deep-link into Smart Segments with pre-loaded filters.

7 · Behavioural nudges


Trigger	Nudge
Active Base shrinks two consecutive months	Red halo on tile + toast: “Patient base slipping—reactivate 20 dormant to reverse.”
Hygiene rate crosses 90 %	Confetti tick 1 s; KPI tile turns mint for the day.
Lost Patients spike insight ignored 3 d	Card border pulses amber once on page load.
8 · Copy library


Context	Copy
Tile tooltip	“Active = visited in last 18 m. Industry median 1 650.”
Funnel hover	“Dormant Jul-23 cohort: 46 pts (–12 vs prior yr).”
Recall heatmap square tooltip	“Due Aug-23, booked within 8 w: 62 %.”
Empty state	“Need at least 60 d of data to chart trends.”
Tone = analyst-coach: factual, motivating, no jargon.

9 · Designer checklist

Hero tiles 260 × 160 px; colour band uses existing mint/amber/coral palette.
Sparkline stroke 1 px; no axes labels inside tiles.
Trend canvas: one chart visible at a time with tab pills (Funnel | Prod/Patient | Recall Cohort).
Use same outlined icon family (📈, 👥, 🛠).
Side-panel width 300 px sticky; each insight card 120 px tall.
Charts built in ApexCharts or Chart.js – muted colours, ADA-compliant contrast.
Result
Patients ▸ Measures becomes leadership’s 60-second pulse check: a glance at four tiles to know growth, new-patient flow, hygiene health, and dormant leakage—then a click on any tile or insight card to jump into the exact Smart Segment list that needs work. The data steward sleeps well; the owner knows where the next dollar (or patient) will appear.
