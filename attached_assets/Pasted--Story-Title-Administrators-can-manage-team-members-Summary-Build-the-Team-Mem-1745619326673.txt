**Story Title**  
*Administrators can manage team members*

---

### Summary  

Build the **Team Members** area under **Settings** so practice staff with administrative privileges can view, add, and edit user accounts end-to-end.

*Why this matters*  
- Keeps staff information accurate and centralized  
- Enforces role-based access using Pixie Dental’s defined roles & account stages   
- Supports growth by letting admins maintain users without developer help  
- Reduces security risk by enabling quick suspension or deactivation of accounts

### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)

#### 1 — Happy-path scenarios  
```
Scenario: Admin lists all team members
  Given I am an authenticated admin
  When I navigate to Settings → Team Members
  Then I see a paginated table of every active, pending, invited, suspended, and deactivated user
  And each row shows Name, Role(s), Account Stage, and Primary Location(s)

Scenario: Admin creates a new team member
  Given I am on the Team Members list
  When I choose “Add Team Member”, complete the form with valid data, and submit
  Then the new user appears in the list with stage “Invited”
  And an invitation email is triggered to the entered address

Scenario: Admin edits a team member
  Given a user named “Dr Lee” exists
  When I open Dr Lee’s detail view, change their phone number, and save
  Then the change is persisted
  And a toast confirms “Team member updated”
```

#### 2 — Alternative-flow scenarios  
```
Scenario: Admin assigns multiple roles to one user
  Given I enter the edit view for “Jordan”
  When I select Dentist and Practice Manager
  Then both roles display in the list view

Scenario: Admin records a custom office location
  Given I am adding a new user
  When I add a location not in the predefined list
  Then the custom location is saved to that practitioner only

Scenario: Admin changes account stage to Suspended
  Given a user is Active
  When I set their stage to Suspended
  Then the user can no longer log in
```

#### 3 — Edge-case scenarios  
```
Scenario: List view with over 1 000 users
  Given the practice has 1 000+ users
  When I load the Team Members page
  Then the first page renders in under 2 seconds
  And pagination controls are present

Scenario: Optional fields left blank
  Given I create a new user without a prefix or secondary email
  Then the submission succeeds
  And blank optional fields do not break the UI
```

#### 4 — Error-case scenarios  
```
Scenario: Duplicate email address
  Given another user already has jordan@example.com
  When I submit a form with jordan@example.com
  Then I see “Email already in use” and the user is not saved

Scenario: Invalid NPI format
  Given I enter an NPI shorter than 10 digits
  When I submit
  Then I see “Enter a 10-digit NPI number”
```

#### 5 — Security scenarios  
```
Scenario: Non-admin access denied
  Given I am logged in as Front Office Staff without admin privilege
  When I attempt to open Settings → Team Members
  Then I receive a “403 Forbidden” message
```

#### 6 — Performance scenarios  
```
Scenario: Bulk update does not block UI
  Given I edit five users in rapid succession
  When each update request completes
  Then the UI remains responsive throughout
```
