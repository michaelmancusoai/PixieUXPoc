Role‑Based “Today” Screens – Magnum Opus Draft (US‑Localised)

“Software should be like the theatre: everyone sees the same stage, yet every seat offers a different, perfectly framed view.” — Rory Sutherland

Pixie Dental will astonish users when Today adapts to their persona, surfacing only what they can influence before their next coffee refill. Below are five role‑crafted panoramas—Front Office, Hygienist, Provider, Billing Specialist, and Practice Owner—each annotated with behavioural psychology cues and sample content.

Universal Skeleton (applied to every role)

Greeting Banner – name, photo, motivational nudge.

Primary KPI Strip – 3–4 metrics each role owns.

Impact Queue – ordered list of actions sorted by ROI × Urgency.

Flow Radar – mini Mission‑Control counts relevant to role.

Win Feed – AI‑handled tasks since last login (reinforces trust).

Spacing, typography, and colour palette remain consistent; only content and ordering shift.

Design Nuances Across Roles

Colour Accent – Each role gets a subtle accent tint: blue (front), teal (hygiene), royal purple (provider), amber (billing), fern (owner). Consistency builds habit without confusion.

Tone of Voice – Front office copy is friendly, billing slightly urgent, owner analytic.

Time Horizon – Front office & hygiene deal in hours; owner sees week & month deltas; UI reflects timeframe.

Example Micro‑Interactions

Hover KPI → “What improves this?” tooltip with single action.

Swipe task → quick‑complete; streak counter appears top‑right.

Empty Impact Queue → confetti burst + message “You’re ahead—review tomorrow’s schedule?”

User Journey Snapshot (Front Office)

Maria logs in 7:40 AM. AI Brief shows “2 unconfirmed”. She hits SMS Blast (single click).

KPI Confirmed % jumps from 83 → 92 %. Progress bar turns green.

Flow Radar shows 1 Checked‑In; Maria prints intake form via row action.

Win Feed records “You secured +$520 by collecting balance at check‑in.” Maria feels victorious before first patient.
